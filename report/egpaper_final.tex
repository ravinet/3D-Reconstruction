%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top
   of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation
   information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point
   Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially
   capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type.
   Leave two blank lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text.
   Look at previous CVPR abstracts to get a feel for style and length.

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}
	Reconstructing a 3D object from input images is an essential task in the field of computer vision. Recent advances in photo databases have led to an increase in the use of 3D reconstruction. While there have been many recent advances in 3D reconstruction, most new techniques still suffer from the same problems which plagued original methods. 
First, many approaches require a camera calibration for each image used in the 3D reconstruction. This calibration is necessary to obtain the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera which are used to project points from 2D images into 3D space. Performing calibrations for each image is impractical for new approaches that emphasize using as many images as possible for the reconstruction.
	The other setback relates to user input. Many approaches require users to pick points on the input images that specify either the object to reconstruct or the planes used to perform the reconstruction. While user input may improve the reconstruction as it improves depth detection and crops the image so only necessary points are used, it does not encourage using many input images. Several techniques overcome these setbacks by performing reconstruction based on uncalibrated images obtained by the same, freely moving camera. Camera calibration must be performed once and the resulting parameters can be used for the reconstruction across all input images. 
	Capturing pairs of feature points from the input images is an important step in the 3D reconstruction process. There are several feature point detection algorithms which are currently used by many reconstruction techniques, though each has its own setbacks. Two popular approaches are Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and corner extraction algorithms such as Harris corner detection. Each approach yields pairs of matched feature points across the input images. 
	In this paper, we develop a new technique which reconstructs a 3D object from two input images captured by a freely moving camera. We then combine SIFT and Harris corner detection to obtain the relevant pairs of feature points from the two input images. Prior to using these matching points, we use the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to remove outlier matches. We calculate the intrinsic parameters of the camera used to take the input images with Zhangâ€™s method. Using the intrinsic parameters of the camera and the matched feature points from the input images, we are able to obtain a 3D reconstruction for the primary object in the image.

\section{Overview}
In this section, we give an overview of our algorithm, and in later sections,
we describe the different components in more details.
\input{overview}

\section{Camera Calibration}
We use a pinhole camera model. Here, we obtain the intrinsic parameters
using Zhang's method.
\input{camera}

\section{Fundamental and Essential Matrix}
The fundamental matrix contains information about the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters
of the camera.

\section{3D reconstruction}
We use the fundamental and essential matrix to reconstruct the 3d image.
\input{reconstruction}

\section{Results}
Here we show some of our reconstructions. We used a camera with the following intrinsic
parameters.

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
following is correct: ``
   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors13} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors13}.

\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
high.
Page numbers should be in footer with page numbers, centered and .75
inches from the bottom of the page and make it start at the correct page
number rather than the 4321 in the example.  To do this fine the line (around
line 23)  
\begin{verbatim}
%\ifcvprfinal\pagestyle{empty}\fi
\setcounter{page}{4321}
\end{verbatim}
where the number 4321 is your assigned starting page.  

Make sure the first page is numbered by commenting out the first page being
empty on line 46
\begin{verbatim}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
\end{verbatim}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors13}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Method & Frobnability \\
\hline\hline
Theirs & Frumpy \\
Yours & Frobbly \\
Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Color}

Color is valuable, and will be visible to readers of the electronic copy.
However ensure that, when printed on a monochrome printer, no important
information is lost by the conversion to grayscale.

\section{Final copy}

You must include your signed IEEE copyright release form when you submit
your finished paper. We MUST have this form before your paper can be
published in the proceedings.
