%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
In this report, we present a 3D reconstruction technique that uses two uncalibrated images, captured by the same freely moving camera, to construct the 
final 3D object. Our method uses both SIFT and 
Harris corner detection as matching feature point detectors to enhance the resulting 3D reconstruction, especially along the edges of the object.  From the matched feature points, we compute the fundamental matrix. Using this, a projective matrix for each input image is obtained, which is used to recover the 3D object. To enhance scaling, we use  Zhang's calibration method which allows camera calibration to happen only once rather than for each input image. We include results from our experiments to show the effectiveness
of this method.

%Compare the following:\\

%\end{tabular}\\
%See The \TeX book, p165.
%
%The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
%sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
%\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.
%
%When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
%shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
%However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
%following is correct: ``
%   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
%   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
%   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''
%
%This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
%because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
%\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
%when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.
%
%For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
%chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors13} to
%\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors13}.

%\subsection{Margins and page numbering}
%
%All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
%within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
%high.
%Page numbers should be in footer with page numbers, centered and .75
%inches from the bottom of the page and make it start at the correct page
%number rather than the 4321 in the example.  To do this fine the line (around
%line 23)  
%\begin{verbatim}
%%\ifcvprfinal\pagestyle{empty}\fi
%\setcounter{page}{4321}
%\end{verbatim}
%where the number 4321 is your assigned starting page.  
%
%Make sure the first page is numbered by commenting out the first page being
%empty on line 46
%\begin{verbatim}
%%\thispagestyle{empty}
%\end{verbatim}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsection{References}

%List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
%single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
%enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
%example~\cite{Authors13}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
%editors of referenced books.

%\hline\hline
%Theirs & Frumpy \\
%Yours & Frobbly \\
%Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}
%\caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
%\end{table}

%%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}
%
%All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
%make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
%to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
%effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
%copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
%insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
%zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.
%
%When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
%\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
%the line width as in the example below
%{\small\begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
%   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
%                   {myfile.eps}
%\end{verbatim}
%}
%
%
%%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsection{Color}
%
%Color is valuable, and will be visible to readers of the electronic copy.
%However ensure that, when printed on a monochrome printer, no important
%information is lost by the conversion to grayscale.
%

%\section{Final copy}
%
%You must include your signed IEEE copyright release form when you submit
%your finished paper. We MUST have this form before your paper can be
%published in the proceedings.
