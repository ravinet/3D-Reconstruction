\section{Overview}
\label{s:overview}

In this section, we give an overview of our algorithm, which we will describe in more detail
in later sections.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{We find the intrinsic parameters of our camera using Zhang's method.}
\item{Using SIFT and Harris corner detection, we identify pairs of features points from both images, and we use RANSAC to find the inliers so that we can generate a representative fundamental matrix.}
\item{With the intrinsic parameters of our camera and the fundamental matrix, we can derive the essential matrix.}
\item{The essential matrix is used to compute the projective matrices of the input images which each comprise of a rotation matrix and translation vector. }
\item{With this information, we can reconstruct the 3D image using triangulation.}
\end{enumerate}
