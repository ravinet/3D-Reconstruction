There has been much work on reconstructing 3D object from multiple images using epipolar geometry. A good review of the methods and previous work in this area can be found here~\cite{epipolar_review}. Our project uses many of these techniques and combines them with more modern automation techniques, such as SIFT and Harris corners to reduce the amount of human interaction required for the reconstruction. Our project is primarily based on the work of Peng et al.~\cite{SIFT/Harris}, where they use these automated techniques to perform the 3D reconstruction.

There is also a separate set of work that tries to do 3D reconstruction using only a single uncalibrated image~\cite{single_image, single_image2}. However, these type of reconstructions require some prior knowledge about the parameters of the scene and the camera. Multiple view 3D reconstruction does not require any prior knowledge because we can extract the necessary parameters from the images.
